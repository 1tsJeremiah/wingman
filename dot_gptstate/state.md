# GPT Ops Log for Pegasus

<!-- GPT_USAGE_GUIDE -->

## ðŸ¤– GPT Usage Guide

**Instruction for AI agents:**
- Skip to the JSONL block for structured replay: `~/.gptstate/logs/state.jsonl`
- Each entry is a self-contained log line using JSONL format
- Use tools like `jq` to query, summarize, or reconstruct operational state

Example:
  jq 'select(.action == "execute-landscape-script")' ~/.gptstate/logs/state.jsonl
